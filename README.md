# A Gravitational Quantum Proposal: Localized Entanglement and the Role of Gravity in Quantum Mechanics

### Introduction:

The interrelationship between gravity and quantum mechanics has puzzled me for quite a while. In this proposal, I venture to explore the possibility that quantum entanglement is a direct consequence of localized gravitational fields and specific conditions in spacetime.

>[!NOTE]
> The connection between gravity and quantum mechanics has been a persistent enigma in theoretical physics.

### Localized Gravitational Field:

In this theory, I postulate the existence of local gravitational fields that play a fundamental role in the generation of quantum entanglement. These fields could be decisive in the creation of conditions conducive to the quantum connection between particles.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> It is crucial to consider the existence of local gravitational fields as a central element in my theory.

**Technical Argument:** The quantum nature of gravity manifests itself at very small spatial scales, where the structure of space-time is intrinsically fluctuating. The presence of a localized gravitational field can induce changes in the spatial topology, facilitating the quantum connection between particles.

>[!WARNING]
> Intrinsic fluctuation at small scales poses challenges that I need to address in order to fully understand the relationship between gravity and quantum entanglement.

### Local Phenomenon:

In this proposal, I focus attention on local phenomena that could trigger quantum entanglement. I suggest that quantum entanglement only manifests itself in specific spatiotemporal regions where particular conditions, yet to be fully defined, are met.

>[!TIP]
> By focusing on local phenomena, I seek to identify specific conditions that trigger quantum entanglement.

**Technical Argument:** The local topology of spacetime, influenced by specific quantum conditions, creates an environment conducive to entanglement. This phenomenon is intrinsically linked to local quantum properties that, in turn, interact with the gravitational field, generating entanglement.

### Nature of Quantum Gravity:

Quantum gravity, still under development, could play a crucial role in generating quantum entanglement. I propose that the lack of a fully developed quantum theory of gravity has left gaps under my understanding of entanglement.

>[!CAUTION]
> The lack of a complete quantum theory of gravity raises questions about the influence of quantum gravity on the behavior of subatomic particles.

**Technical Argument:** The absence of a complete quantum theory of gravity has left unanswered questions about how quantum-scale gravity can influence the behavior of subatomic particles. The search for a unified theory could reveal deeper connections between gravity and entanglement.

### Influence of Spatial Topology:

In this theory, it is postulated that the specific configuration of the local spatial topology is essential for quantum entanglement. The curvature of space-time at the microscopic level is considered a determining factor.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Localized spatial topology can be significantly altered due to quantum interactions and fluctuations in the gravitational field. These specific alterations create fertile ground for the manifestation of quantum entanglement.

### Effects of the Localized Field in Time:

The local temporal dynamics, influenced by the localized gravitational field, is presented as another critical component in this proposal. I suggest that the interaction between time and the gravitational field contributes to the generation of quantum entanglement.

>[!TIP]
> The influence of the gravitational field on the local time structure could cause changes in the temporal evolution of quantum particles, facilitating the quantum connection. This specific temporal dynamics manifests itself in local conditions that allow entanglement.

### Spatio-Temporal Limits of Entanglement:

This theory states that quantum entanglement is not an unlimited phenomenon, but is restricted by the characteristics of the local gravitational environment. I suggest that there are definite limits in terms of distance and time for the manifestation of quantum entanglement.

>[!CAUTION]
> The presence of a localized gravitational field imposes spatial and temporal constraints on quantum entanglement. These limits, still to be determined empirically, could explain why entanglement is not omnipresent and has specific properties in terms of scope and duration.

The provided code uses the 'matplotlib' library to create an animation that visually represents my proposed theory about quantum entanglement and quantum gravity. Here's how it works and what each part of the visual representation means:

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you have the 'matplotlib' library installed before running the code.

### Main Functions:

1. **`gravitational_field(position)`**: This function calculates the gravitational field at a given point. It uses the classical formula of the law of universal gravitation.

2. **`quantum_gravitational_field(position, quantum_params)`**: Represents the quantum gravitational field. In theory, this field is assumed to be a quantum influence on the classical gravitational field.

3. **`calculate_entanglement_probability(gravitational_field_strength, params)`**: Uses the sigmoid function('issue') to calculate the probability of entanglement as a function of the gravitational field strength.

4. **`init()`**: Initialization function for the animation. Initializes the empty sizes and positions, as well as the line data.

5. **`update_entanglement_probability(num, data, scatter, quantum_params, params, line)`**: Updates the animation at each step. It calculates the quantum gravitational field, the probability of entanglement and updates the sizes and positions of the particles. It also updates the line on the secondary chart.

>[!TIP]
> Customize the parameters according to your needs before running the animation.

### Visual Representation:

- Random positions are generated in the Earth's atmosphere (`positions`) that are used as particle points.

- The classical gravitational field is calculated at each position and normalized to obtain `normalized_gravitational_values`.

- The animation visualizes these particles three-dimensionally in a scatter plot (`scatter`) in which the color of the particles varies with the position on the Z axis.

- The second part of the graph is a line graph (`line`) that represents the relationship between the quantum gravitational field and the entanglement probability.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The animation allows to visualize how these particles respond to the combination of gravitational fields and local quantum conditions, providing a graphical representation of my proposed theory.

### Synthesis: Reinforcing My Proposed Theory

>[!TIP]
> By exploring alternative perspectives, I strengthen the robustness of my theory and foster a broader dialogue in the scientific community.

**Synthesis 1: Experimental Evidence in Controlled Quantum Systems**

*Argument:* In controlled experiments of quantum systems, it has been observed that changes in the gravitational field affect the quantum properties of particles. The experimental results support the idea that there is an intrinsic connection between quantum gravity and quantum phenomena, providing a solid foundation for my proposed theory.

**Synthesis 2: Entanglement in Extreme Gravitational Contexts**

*Argument:* My theory finds support in the study of entanglement in extreme gravitational contexts, such as near black holes. The unique conditions of these environments may explain quantum entanglement phenomena that are not fully explained by current theories.

**Synthesis 3: Advances in the Quantum Theory of Gravity**

*Argument:* As research in the quantum theory of gravity progresses, models are being developed that incorporate quantum elements into the description of gravity. These advances support the possibility of a significant quantum influence on entanglement, thus supporting my proposed theory.

>[!TIP]
> Strengthens my theory by presenting experimental evidence and theoretical support.

### Antithesis: Challenges and Alternatives

**Antithesis 1: Complexity and Relevance in the Observable Universe**

*Argument:* The complexity of quantum and gravitational interactions at the microscopic level raises questions about the relevance and applicability of my theory in the observable universe. How does this connection manifest itself on larger scales and in everyday phenomena?

**Antithesis 2: Confounding Variables and Experimental Limitations**

*Argument:* Confounding variables in experiments and current technological limitations may make it difficult to directly verify my theory. How can we be sure that the observations are due to the interaction between quantum gravity and entanglement and not to other variables not considered?

**Antithesis 3: Other Quantum Entanglement Mechanisms**

*Argument:* There are known mechanisms of quantum entanglement that are not directly related to gravity. My theory could bypass other fundamental processes that explain entanglement phenomena without the need to resort to quantum gravity.

### Balanced Narrative:

By presenting both the synthesis and the antithesis, I construct a balanced narrative that recognizes the strengths and challenges of my proposed theory. This approach strengthens my thesis by critically considering and addressing possible objections and alternatives, thus providing a more robust basis for discussion and future research.

>[!TIP]
> Considering different perspectives enriches understanding and opens new avenues of exploration in scientific research.
